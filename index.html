    <h1>Disaster Risk Reduction and Management in the Philippines</h1>
    <p>
      Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) in the Philippines refers to
      the systematic approach and strategies implemented to minimize the risks
      and vulnerabilities associated with natural and human-induced hazards. ICT
      plays a crucial role in DRRM in the Philippines. It enables enhanced
      communication, data collection and analysis, early warning
      systems,information sharing and coordination, as well as disaster
      preparedness and training.
